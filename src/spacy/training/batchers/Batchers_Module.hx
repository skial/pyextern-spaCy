		Union type; Union[X, Y] means either X or Y.
		
		To define a union, use e.g. Union[int, str].  Details:
		- The arguments must be types and there must be at least one.
		- None as an argument is a special case and is replaced by
		  type(None).
		- Unions of unions are flattened, e.g.::
		
		    Union[Union[int, str], float] == Union[int, str, float]
		
		- Unions of a single argument vanish, e.g.::
		
		    Union[int] == int  # The constructor actually returns int
		
		- Redundant arguments are skipped, e.g.::
		
		    Union[int, str, int] == Union[int, str]
		
		- When comparing unions, the argument order is ignored, e.g.::
		
		    Union[int, str] == Union[str, int]
		
		- You cannot subclass or instantiate a union.
		- You can use Optional[X] as a shorthand for Union[X, None].
