		Minibatch a sequence by the size of padded batches that would result,

		Encode labelled spans into per-token tags, using the
		Begin/In/Last/Unit/Out scheme (BILUO).
		
		doc (Doc): The document that the entity offsets refer to. The output tags
		    will refer to the token boundaries within the document.
		entities (iterable): A sequence of `(start, end, label)` triples. `start`
		    and `end` should be character-offset integers denoting the slice into
		    the original string.
		missing (str): The label used for missing values, e.g. if tokenization
		    doesn’t align with the entity offsets. Defaults to "O".
		RETURNS (list): A list of unicode strings, describing the tags. Each tag
		    string will be of the form either "", "O" or "{action}-{label}", where
		    action is one of "B", "I", "L", "U". The missing label is used where the
		    entity offsets don't align with the tokenization in the `Doc` object.
		    The training algorithm will view these as missing values. "O" denotes a
		    non-entity token. "B" denotes the beginning of a multi-token entity,
		    "I" the inside of an entity of three or more tokens, and "L" the end
		    of an entity of two or more tokens. "U" denotes a single-token entity.
		
		EXAMPLE:
		    >>> text = 'I like London.'

		    >>> doc = nlp.tokenizer(text)
		    >>> tags = offsets_to_biluo_tags(doc, entities)
